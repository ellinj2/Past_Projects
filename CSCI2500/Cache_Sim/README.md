# Cache_Sim

This project takes in the cache associativity number, a series of cache address calls, and a replacement method (Belady or LRU) and prints each call and whether it was a hit or a miss. At the end, it prints statistics about how many hit and how many missed. Usage: code.exe associativity_integer replacement_method input.txt

## Files

- **hw6_final.c**: Main code with all necessary structs and functions that runs the simulation and hit/miss ratio calculations

- **[]output.txt**: Sample output files paired with samenumbered input files

- **[]input.txt**: Sample input files of cache accesses
