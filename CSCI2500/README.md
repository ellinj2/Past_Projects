# CSCI2500

Projects completed for the Computer Organization course at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute using the C and MIPS32 languages

## Subfolders

- **C_Assembler**: This project takes in C code as a .src file and prints the relative MIPS32 instructions

- **Cache_Sim**: This project takes in a series of memory address calls and prints if each call is a cache hit or a cache miss using either Belady sorting or LRU sorting, then prints statistics about the call list

- **Pipeline_Sim**: This was a group-based final project that I completed with Ohad Nir, Xavier Marshall, and Ayannah Vasquez. The project takes in MIPS32 code as a .txt file and a Forwarding command, then prints a simulation of what the processor pipeline looks like across multiple iterations and tracks values stored in the registers
