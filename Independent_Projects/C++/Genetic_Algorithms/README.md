- **simple_dna**: This project creates generations of dna sequences, each of which hold 20 genomes with 8 base purines. The sequences are scored based on alphabetical order of purine bases. The 5 highest scoring sequences are bred with mutation to create the next generation. This continues until a certain best score is reached
