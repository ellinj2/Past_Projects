	<h1>Critical CS</h1>
	Published Paper(s): <a href="documents/Malazita_Resetar.pdf" target="_blank">Infrastructures of Abstraction</a>
	<p></p>
	<p>STEM education used to include a focus on ethics and the real-world impact of engineering and science beyond the scope of just the goals of any particular project. In recent times, this focus on ethics has been abandoned in favor of training and practice in the "practical" skills needed for the field (e.g. coding, optimization, efficiency). Critical CS hopes to reintroduce ethics and societal impact through hands-on practice and readings to show students that ethics is a necessary consideration in any and all aspects of STEM.</p>
	<p>I held the role of mentor for my first semester on the team. I was responsible for running the coding side of labs, helping students understand and find solutions to our custom homework, and holding regular office hours. In my second semester, I helped work on rewriting and redesigning homework as we started considering expanding how many lab sections we operated on. Now that we are looking to wrap up the project and produce broader materials, I am leading the homework development team to design homework problems that sufficiently introduce students to topics in coding, computer science, and ethics. I'm also in charge of finding and analyzing potential readings to assign alongside these assignments.</p>
