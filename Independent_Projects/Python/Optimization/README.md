# Optimization

Collection of various optimization methods including but not limited to multithreading, asyncio, multiprocessing, and mutlisync. Programs that "download data" download data from hundreds of websites and prints how long it took to download

## Files

- **Threaded.py**: Program that uses threads to download data

- **asyncio.py**: Program that uses asynchronous frameworks to download data

- **cpuMultiProcess.py**: Program that uses CPU multiprocessing to perform massive amounts of computations

- **cpuTest.py**: Basecase for cpuMultiProcess.py. Runs the same computations but without multiprocessing

- **multiProcess.py**: Program that uses CPU multiprocessing to download data

- **opTest.py**: Basecase for "download data" programs. Runs same operations but without optimizations
