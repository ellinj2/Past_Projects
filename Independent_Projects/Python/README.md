This folder contains all projects completed using the Python language

## Files

- **Ducci2.py**: Simple algorithm that takes in an array and returns the associated Ducci sequence (sequence where each item is the difference of neighbors in the original sequence). e.g. [0,1,2,3,4,5]->[1,1,1,1,1,5]

- **PHYSTEMP.py**: A collection of operations and algorithms used in Physics 1 including quadratic formula, relative gravity, scientific notation, and attempted significant figure calculation

- **TransitionalProbabilityMatrix.py**: Collection of data structures and algorithms that will compute and present the transition probability matrix and iterative probabilities for constructed graphs

- **fibonacci_round.py**: Custom rounding method to round a number to the next fibonacci sequence value

## Subfolders

- **MatPlotLib**: Simple implementation of MatPlotLib library to display graphs in TKinter interface

- **Optimization**: Test runs of various optimization methods including but not limited to threading, mutliprocessing, asyncio, and multisync
