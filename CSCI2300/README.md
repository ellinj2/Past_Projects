- **Simple_Graph_Analysis**: **_REQUIRES PLOTLY(4.2.1).GRAPH_OBJECTS_** The user is prompted for a checkpoint ("a", "b", or "c").   
  - Checkpoint "a" creates a graph with 5 vertices and edge probability 0.7 and prints the edges and vertices created.
  - Checkpoint "b" creates a graph with 5 vertices and edge probability 0.5, then runs an algorithm to find a connected component with at least 3 vertices
  - Checkpoint "c" runs 14 simulations on a graph with 40 vertices with edge probability of c/40 for c in range(0.2,3.0,increment=0.2). 500 graphs are created for each c value. A plot is then populated using plotly.graph_objects that displays how many of the graphs at each c value had a connected component with at least 30 vertices
