- **RouteFinder**: Takes in a file storing locations as "name,ID,x-coordinate,y-coordinate" and a file storing paths as "start ID,end ID" and builds a weighted, undirected Graph using paths as Edges and locations as Vertices. Then uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find and print the shortest path between two user-input buildings. Originally designed in the context of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute campus.
