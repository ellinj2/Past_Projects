# Simple_Spell_Check

This project is a simple spell checker. The algorithm takes in three files: a set of input words, a set of possible words and their relative probabilities, and an adjacency list for keyboard letters. The algorithm then parses the input words and prints the 3 most likely words and the method used to find that word

## Files

- **hw7Part1.py**: Main file that parses given files and runs "drop", "swap", "insert", and "replace" operations on characters in the given words to determine potential spelling corrections, printing the three most likely words the given word was trying to be and how that word was found

- **input_words.txt**: Set of input words to be corrected

- **keyboard.txt**: Adjacency list of keyboard characters and characters nearby

- **words_10percent.txt**: Set of real words and the relative probability of that word being used
